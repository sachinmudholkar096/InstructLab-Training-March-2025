Background

It is the mission of NYSDOT to provide a safe, reliable, equitable, and resilient transportation system that connects communities, enhances quality of life, protects the environment, and supports the economic well-being of New York State.To attain its mission the responsibilities, functions and duties of NYSDOT include coordinating and developing comprehensive transportation policy for the State; coordinating and assisting in the development and operation of transportation facilities and services for highways, railroads, mass transit systems, ports, waterways and aviation facilities.

NYSDOT employs a structured approach to project development, guided by comprehensive manuals and federal requirements. One key resource is the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) Guidebook for Project Sponsors, which assists in aligning local projects with state and federal objectives.​

Another document, the Local Projects Manual (LPM) was developed to assist New York State municipalities, Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and their consultants in the steps, activities, approvals, and other requirements needed to ensure that Federally Aided projects are: developed, designed, and constructed in accordance with Federal and State requirements.

Use Case Justification:

​Integrating a chatbot within NYSDOT that is knowledgeable on project guidelines can significantly enhance internal processes by providing quick access to essential guidance documents. Both the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) Guidebook for Project Sponsors and Local Projects Manual (LPM) assist stakeholders like municipalities with navigating the complexities of locally administered federal-aid projects. A chatbot could offer comprehensive guidance on the processes and documentation required to progress with such projects, ensuring compliance with federal and state regulations. ​Outcomes can include better understanding of requirements, and speed up project proposal times.

Other benefits include:

- Instant Access: A chatbot can provide immediate access to specific sections of the LPM, allowing project sponsors and internal staff to quickly find information pertinent to their needs.​
- Clarification of Procedures: Users can query the chatbot for explanations on particular processes outlined in the LPM, such as project initiation, environmental reviews, or funding requisites.​
- Document Retrieval: The chatbot can facilitate the download of necessary forms and templates referenced within the LPM, streamlining project documentation.​
- Updates and Notifications: By integrating with NYSDOT's databases, the chatbot can notify users of any updates or revisions to the LPM, ensuring adherence to the latest guidelines.

Goal of POC: Convey how an LLM trained on the TIP and at least 2 chapters of the LPM (potentially more) could provide both DOT and NYS municipalities with better understanding of DOT project requirements along with federal standards and regulations.
