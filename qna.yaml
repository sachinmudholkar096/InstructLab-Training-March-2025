  - context: |
      The Procedures for Locally Administered Federal Aid Projects (PALAP) is intended to assist non New York State Local Project Sponsors, municipalities, Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who seek federal funding through
      the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) , as well as state funding from New York State. The PALAP aims to provide an overview of the processes, procedures, documentation, authorizations, approvals, and certifications required
      throughout the scoping, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation-related projects. While all attempts have been made to create a manual as comprehensive as possible, the dynamics of federal and state policy make it
      reasonable to expect that the reader will need to have other references at hand as well.NYSDOT developed the procedures in cooperation with FHWA and representatives of the NYS County Highway Superintendents
      Association (NYSCHSA) and other external stakeholders. These organizations administer locally administered federal and state-aided transportation projects.Periodic updates are necessary to reflect changes in laws, rules, regulations, and executive orders, along with the institutional knowledge gained in the
      evolving practice of non NYSDOT administered federal and state aid transportation projects. Revision dates can typically be found in the footer of each chapter.
