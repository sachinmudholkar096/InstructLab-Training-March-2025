## 9.1 INTRODUCTION

This  chapter  directs  the  designer  to  the  design  standards,  design  guidance,  other  technical guidelines, and construction &amp; materials specifications which must be followed when designing a locally administered Federal-aid transportation project.

Once design standards and construction specifications have been established, they should be set forth in the Design Report and the design section of the Project Management Plan (PMP) (see Chapter 2).  The PMP, which is required for all projects, shall clearly identify the parties responsible  for  the  Quality  Assurance  (QA)  and  the  Quality  Control  (QC)  of  the  design, materials, and construction of the project.

When a local project sponsor (Sponsor) prepares contract documents using New York State Department  of  Transportation  (NYSDOT)  Specifications,  Standard  Sheets,  plans,  procedure manuals,  and/or  other  design  &amp;  construction  documents;  and  these  documents  reference NYSDOT performing review &amp; approval during design, or on-site inspection during construction; it  is  to  be  understood that such activities are actually the responsibility of the Sponsor's NYSlicensed design professional .  The Sponser must identify and document in both the Project and 1 Construction Management plans who will be performing these functions when NYSDOT will not be.  Contact the Regional Local Project Liaison (RLPL) for assistance defining these roles.

For  certain  construction  materials,  NYSDOT  Specifications  call  for  off-site  QA  (which  can include shop drawing review).  In these instances and when the transportation project is on the State or National Highway System, the QA will be performed by NYSDOT.  When off the State or  National  Highway  Systems,  QA  remains  the  Sponsor's  responsibility.    However,  in  these cases, the Sponsor may still request assistance from NYSDOT.  If NYSDOT will not be involved in  the  material  approval  or  inspections  required  by  NYSDOT  Standard  Specifications,  the Sponsor must provide an appropriate level of approval and inspection not to be performed by the contractor .  In either case, the process for material approval and inspections required by NYSDOT Standard Specifications; Construction and Materials should be clearly stated in the Construction  Management  Plan (CMP)  and  covered  by  a  note  in  the  bid  documents  (see Chapter 12).

NYSDOT  will  be  responsible  for  QA  for  project  elements  involving  innovative  or  unique materials, construction methods, or structures.

## 9.2 DESIGN STANDARDS

NYSDOT design standards are based generally on American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards and have been approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for use on all Federal-aid projects.

AASHTO  design  standards,  developed  and  approved  by  a  committee  of  Federal  and  State transportation officials, are based on decades of research and multinational experience, and are tailored  to  the  highway  functional  class,  design  speed,  terrain,  traffic  volumes,  and  other characteristics of the highway.  They apply to all types of road facilities, and recent studies have confirmed their cost effectiveness.

For  all  locally  administered  Federal-aid  transportation  projects  in  New  York  State,  Sponsors (except  for  cities  with  populations  greater  than  three  million)  must  use  NYSDOT  design standards for all projects regardless of highway system. Project elements for which NYSDOT or AASHTO have no established standards must conform to appropriate Federal, state, local, or industry codes &amp; standards, as approved by NYSDOT.  An automated tool is available to help generate a table of design criteria  to be included in the design approval document is available 2 from NYSDOT.

In general, locally administered Federal-aid transportation projects must be designed to meet or exceed  the  critical  design  criteria  elements  in  Chapter  2  of  the NYSDOT  Highway  Design Manual (HDM)  and  Section  2  of  the NYSDOT Bridge Manual. However, AASHTO standard values may be used for the criteria for segments of projects off the State Highway System.   In some situations it may be appropriate to not meet these standards entirely because slightly less stringent values can still allow the Sponsor to build a project that is safe and of good quality, but in a more cost-effective manner.  When requesting the inclusion of nonstandard design features into  a  project,  the  Sponsor  must  submit  a  formal  justification  to  the  Regional  Local  Project Liaison  (RLPL)  who  will  coordinate  its  review  and  approval  (see  HDM  Chapter  2).    When evaluating  nonstandard  elements,  some  factors  NYSDOT  will  consider  include  accident analyses,  cost,  compatibility  with  adjacent  sections,  environmental  impacts,  Right-of-Way (ROW) impacts, etc.

In addition to the critical design elements, there are other design elements (see HDM Chapter 5) with  established  values  or  parameters  which  must  also  be  considered  when  scoping  and designing a project.  These additional elements are important because they can considerably affect  the  cost,  scope,  schedule,  and  quality  of  a  project.    Prior  to  design  approval,  any decisions to vary from recommended values or accepted practices for these elements must be explained and documented in the scoping and/or Design Approval Documents.  When identified after  design  approval,  a  re-evaluation  of  Design  Approval  Documents  might  be  required  (this must be documented in project files).  The more significant the deviation, or the more important an element is to quality design, the more detailed the explanation must be.

The Project Approvals Matrix (see Chapter 8) identifies which authorities have jurisdiction over the approval of nonstandard features, and the Chapter 8 Appendix includes a form for preparing a  nonstandard  feature  justification.    Work  on  or  related  to  more  than  one  system  (e.g.,  local bridge over an Interstate, intersection reconstruction with only one route on the NHS), evaluated with  associated  cost  estimates  for  each  system,  affects  approval  authority.    Refer  to  the footnotes in the Matrix for further guidance.

## 9.2.1 Justification of Nonstandard Features

A nonstandard feature occurs when established design criteria for a critical design element are not  met.    All  nonstandard  features  to  be  retained  must  be  listed,  justified,  and  approved  in accordance with HDM Chapter 2 and the NYSDOT Project Development Manual (PDM).

Many of the values for critical design elements depend on design speed.  The selection and justification of a nonstandard design speed, however, is not permitted (23 CFR 625).  Instead, the  design  speed  should  be  determined  (in  accordance  with  HDM  Chapter  2),  and  any

nonstandard critical design elements individually justified.  Design Approval Documents.  Refer to HDM Chapter 5 for further information about these types of design elements.

To support the rationale for including a nonstandard feature, a completed Nonstandard Feature Justification Form (HDM Exhibit 2-15) must be provided, or an explanation given as to why the information requested in the form was not considered applicable.  This is required only for the alternative for which design approval is sought.

The following is additional guidance for completing the Nonstandard Feature Justification Form .

Similar features with similar accident histories may be justified with a single form.  Examples of  those  which  may  be  grouped  together  include:  a  series  of  curves  with  similar  radii, shoulders on a grouping of similar ramps, and bridge widths for a series of bridges to be rehabilitated or replaced in a future project.

Advisory Speed - The advisory speed is defined in Section 2C-46 of the New York State Supplement to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices .  The advisory speed may be determined by calculating the speed from the existing geometry and from formulas in HDM Chapter 5.  The advisory speed for horizontal alignment may also be determined using a ball bank indicator reading as per §2C-46 of the NYS Supplement .  Note that the results will differ slightly for each of these methods.

Accident Analysis - Refer to HDM Chapter 5.

Cost Estimates -An  approximate  construction cost estimate should be used. A Benefit/Cost ratio should be determined and should consider accident cost, user delay, etc.

Mitigation Measures - Refer to the accident reduction factors  on the NYSDOT website for a 3 list  of  measures  to  consider  and  for  guidance  in  evaluating  their  effectiveness.    If  further assistance is required, contact the RLPL for consultation with the Regional Traffic Group.

As  suggested  above,  strictly  adhering  to  the  Design  Standards  in  all  instances  may  be inappropriate.    Instead,  they  should  serve  as  a  guide,  since  the  Standards  are  often  set  at discrete thresholds for variables which in reality exist across a continuous range.  Furthermore, if a sidewalk, ramp, curb ramp, stairway, or other pedestrian facility cannot fully comply with the accessibility standards found in the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG), then follow the guidance in HDM §18.6.1, the facility must still be made accessible to the maximum extent practicable .

The reasons that full compliance with the guidelines might not be feasible must be documented in the Design Approval Document and be consistent with the definition of Technical Infeasibility (HDM §18.4) and ADAAG justification requirements.

## 9.2.2    Non-Conforming Features

In  addition  to  the  critical  design  elements  covered  in  HDM  Chapter  2  there  are  other  design elements with established values or parameters requiring consideration.  While not identified as critical design elements, they are nonetheless important and can significantly affect a project. Any decision to vary from recommended values or accepted practices needs to be explained

and documented (as nonconforming features) in the scoping/design approval documents.  Refer to HDM Chapter 5 for further information about these types of design elements. The following references  may  be  used  to  support  justifying  the  inclusion  or  retention  of  nonstandard  and nonconforming  features  (to  address  accident  history,  environmental  impacts,  cost  to  correct, etc.):

- · AASHTO's A Guide for Achieving Flexibility in Highway Design (current edition)
- · Proposed Treatments for the Rehabilitation of the National Register Eligible Long Island Parkways , December 1997.
- · Recommendations of the Parkway Standard Task Force , Jan 1989 (amended 10/25/90)
- · NYS Scenic Byways Program: Individual Corridor Management Plans

During the project development process trade-offs of various attribute values of design elements are routinely evaluated.  Quantitative measures (safety, constructability, environmental effects, cost,  etc.)  should  be  used,  whenever possible, to compare the consequences of the different options.  When NYSDOT evaluates such trade-offs in the course of considering transportation needs and community needs, public safety remains a foremost issue, as it should for Sponsors.

As  stated  before,  the  more  significant  the  deviation  or  the  more  important  an  element  is  to quality design, the more detailed its explanation needs to be.  For example, a justification similar in  detail  to  the  requirements  for  a nonstandard feature  is  appropriate  for  a nonconforming feature if a Sponsor proposes to build an acceleration lane at 75% of the length recommended in AASHTO's A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets .  On the other hand, not achieving the minimum length of a superelevation runout by a few feet would only warrant a brief explanation in the report.

The following is a listing of some of the other elements which are described in detail in the HDM. It  is  being  provided  here  to  give  a  representative  sample  of  items  to  be  considered  when scoping and designing a project. It is not in order of priority or intended to be all-inclusive.

- · Level of Service (LOS) (This is a critical design element on Interstate projects only.)
- · Intersection radii (including accommodation of identified oversized vehicles)
- · Clear zone
- · Intersection and decision sight distance
- · Superelevation runoff/runout length
- · Lane drops
- · Minimum length of vertical curves
- · Broken back curves
- · Auxiliary lane lengths
- · Compound curves
- · Adequate provisions for pedestrians and bicyclists (See Chapter 18 of this manual)
- · Design storm for drainage facilities (see Chapter 8)
- · Transit and High-Occupancy Vehicle facilities and accommodations
- · Curbing
- · Permanent and temporary soil erosion and sediment control
- · Guide rail

## 9.2.3 Approval Authority for Non-Conforming and Non-Standard Features

Revised

March 2011

Table 8-1, Project Approvals Matrix, identifies the approval authorities for important milestones of the preliminary design process.  Other required steps and approvals can be found in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the Project Development Manual (PDM).

The following PDM subsections apply to a project occurring on more than one system:

- 4.2.5.1 Approvals for: Design, PS&amp;E &amp; Amendments
- 4.2.5.2 Non-Standard Feature Approval

HDM Chapters 2, 4, and 7 describe the critical design elements and procedure to follow when one  or  more  of  these  standards  can  not  be  achieved.    Nonstandard  features  off  the  State system  and  off  the  NHS  may  be  approved  by  the  responsible  local  official  (or  designee)  in coordination with other agencies, groups, stakeholders, etc.  The approval shall be based on a request  memo  that  includes  certification  by  the  NYS-licensed  design  professional  who  is  in responsible charge of the project.  Nonstandard features on the State system or the NHS are to be  approved  by  the  Region  (Regional  Director  or  designee),  Main  Office  (Deputy  Chief Engineer), or FHWA as indicated in the Non-Standard Feature column of PDM Exhibit 4-2.

The profile and span length of a bridge are normally set to allow the geometry of the underlying transportation  facility  to  adhere  to  standard  design.    When  standards  cannot  be  met  for  the underlying  travelway,  the  proposed  nonstandard  or  nonconforming  features  must  be  justified and  subsequently  approved  by  the  individual  with  authority  for  the  impacted  facility,  as determined  from  PDM  Exhibit  4-2.    In  coordination  with  its  owner,  the  Regional  Director  will approve nonstandard features on a locally owned facility.  Nonstandard features for the bridge and approaches are to be approved by the individual with authority for the travelway carried by the bridge (PDM Exhibit 4-2).

NYSDOT design standards and construction specifications are included in the current edition of the following:

## Innovative or Nontraditional Projects

- · Innovative and nontraditional projects are those which require a unique approach to the design, construction, or material aspects of the project.  Additionally, a project may be considered unusual because: (a) NYSDOT has no experience with its type, (b) its design is  not  partially  or  fully  covered  by  existing  specifications,  (c)  it  requires  uncommon  or single-source materials, construction options, or maintenance of traffic, or (d) the design method required is not in regular use.  Examples of innovative or nontraditional projects could include ferry terminals, railroad spurs, historic building rehabilitations, etc.
- · Innovative or nontraditional bridges are special cases for bridge design.  They typically require the development of special design criteria, which goes beyond the provisions of the NYSDOT LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. These types of bridge projects shall be progressed following §20.2.2 of the NYSDOT Bridge Manual .
- · The project designer must make the innovative/nontraditional project determination as early  in  the  project  development  process  as  practical.    The  designer  must  notify  the RLPL  once  the  project  has  been  identified  as  such.  This  determination  must  be documented in the Design Approval Document and must provide the rationale for the recommendation, including unique project characteristics, proposed design and construction methods, proposed materials, and any relevant technical justifications.

Revised March 2011

- · The  RLPL  will  obtain  concurrence  from  the  Regional  Director  (or  designee)  that  the project is unusual.  If so, the project will be reviewed by the appropriate NYSDOT staff and experts in the areas relevant to the unique features of the project.  This review must provide a recommendation as to the need for any additional technical progress reviews or peer reviews to be included as part of the project's QA process.

## All Projects

- · NYSDOT is responsible for the State Highway System.  The use of NYS highway ROW must be in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Highway Work Permit  issued 6 by  the  Commissioner  of  Transportation  or  a  duly  assigned  agent,  in  accordance  with NYS Highway Law §52. In order to conduct any work on the State or National Highway System, a Highway Work Permit must be obtained.

## 9.3 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS

Locally administered Federal-aid transportation projects must be constructed in accordance with the current version of NYSDOT Standard Specifications; Construction and Materials including any and all modifications to the Standard Specifications issued by the Engineering Information Issuance System , and NYSDOT-approved Special Specifications for general use (cities with a population of 3 million or more may pursue approval of their own construction specifications on a project by project basis and then be allowed to use these approved construction specifications for general use thereafter).

When  a  project  includes an element  not specifically addressed  in NYSDOT  Standard Specifications; Construction and Materials or in a NYSDOT-approved Special Specification for general (as opposed to project-specific) use, the designer must generate a Special Specification (see  Section  9.3.3).    All  design  standards  and  specifications  must comply  with  Federal  and State laws, rules, and regulations and must be prepared and endorsed by a design professional licensed in New York State, whose field of practice and expertise is in the discipline of the work type.    Sponsors  may  incorporate  NYSDOT Special Specifications (approved for  general use) into contract documents, and the RLPL will help locate those applicable.

## 9.3.1 QA for Projects on the State or National Highway System

For projects (or segments) on the State or National Highway System, NYSDOT will perform offsite  QA  and  approval  for  materials  as  required  by  the NYSDOT  Standard  Specifications; Construction  and  Materials the  same  as  it  would  for  State-let  projects.    The  Sponsor  must document  this  fact  in  the  CMP  (see  Chapter  12)  and  via  a  Special  Note  in  the  contract documents, a suggested sample of which is provided below:

## Special Note:

- 1. The contractor understands and agrees the inspection and approval of materials to be used on this project will be performed by NYSDOT.
- 2. When  the  contractor  receives  direction  from  NYSDOT  regarding  the  approval/rejection  of materials  such  as  hot  mix  asphalt,  Portland  cement  concrete,  structural  steel,  concrete structural elements and/or components, the contractor understands the decision is final and will accept it as such.

- 3. The  contractor  will  not  allow  off-site  materials  subject  to  the  inspection  and  approval  of NYSDOT to be shipped to the project site prior to receiving authorization from NYSDOT.
- 4. As  soon  after  award  as  practicable,  and  prior  to  the  pre-construction  conference,  the contractor  shall  provide  the  following  information  to  the  Sponsor  and  NYSDOT  Regional Local Project Liaison.
- A. The  name  and  address  of  each  manufacturer  of  all  materials  and  portions  thereof requiring  off-site  quality  assurance  in  accordance  with  NYSDOT's  specifications  to  be used in this project.
- B. The name and address of each fabricator fabricating structural steel items or any portion thereof to be used in this project.
- C. The name and address of each fabricator manufacturing structural concrete items or any portion thereof to be used in this project.
- 5. The contractor agrees that it and its subcontractors and suppliers will only acquire materials for this project through NYSDOT-approved manufacturing, batching and fabrication facilities.

## 9.3.2 QA for Projects off the State or National Highway System

For projects off the State or National Highway System (including highways which are signed as US or NY touring routes but are not State-owned) NYSDOT may want  to  be  involved  in  the material testing and approval (QA) required by NYSDOT Standard Specifications; Construction and  Materials .    The  RLPL  must  be  consulted  during  the  Initial  Project  Proposal  (IPP)  for  a determination as to who will be responsible for material approval and inspections.

- If NYSDOT  is  not  involved  in the QA  required by NYSDOT  Standard  Specifications; Construction  and  Materials ,  the  Sponsor  must  provide  the  appropriate  level  of  approval  and inspection.

In  either  case,  the  process  for  material  approval  and  inspections  required  by  the NYSDOT Standard  Specifications;  Construction  and  Materials must  be  clearly  stated  in  the  CMP  and covered by a Special Note in the contract documents.

Under  no  circumstance  shall  the  contractor  provide  Quality  Assurance .  Quality  Assurance  is material testing, and approval process and can either be supplied by the Sponsor through its Construction  Inspection  firm  or  an  independent  testing  firm  or  a  combination  of  both.    The contractor is responsible for the Quality Control (QC) of their activities.

## 9.3.3 Special Specifications

NYSDOT  Special  Specifications  are  written  by  the  Regions,  various  Main  Office  functional groups, and other agencies, such as the NYS Thruway Authority, to specify work not addressed in the NYSDOT Standard Specifications; Construction and Materials .  Special Specifications are typically developed for items which are infrequently used (e.g., nontraditional projects containing architectural components).  Sponsors are encouraged to use these previously-approved Special Specifications,  which  can  be  found  in  NYSDOT's  Pay  Item  Catalog .    The  RLPL  should  be 7 consulted if the Sponsor has any difficulty locating a Special Specification.

Detailed information about Special Specifications and guidelines on creating new ones can be found in HDM Chapter 21, Contract Plans, Specifications, and Estimates .

After creating the new specification or modifying an existing one, the Sponsor must submit the specification  with  justification  to  the  RLPL  for  review  and  approval by  the  appropriate  subject matter experts in coordination with NYSDOT's Design Quality Assurance Bureau (DQAB) .  The 8 request for Special Specification review and  approval  must  contain  enough  supporting information, including whether or not it is safety related, so a reviewer can make an informed decision regarding its suitability.  No Special Specifications will be reviewed or approved without supporting justification (as discussed in the HDM).  NYSDOT has Special Specification approval authority even when the items are not safety related and (a) do not require off-site QA, or (b) the Sponsor provides an equivalent level of off-site QA, or (c) NYSDOT desires to be involved in the material testing and approval (QA) required by NYSDOT Standard Specifications; Construction and Materials .  During IPP development the Sponsor needs to be in consultation with the RLPL in the determination of QA responsibility.

Special  specifications  for  safety-related  items  including  structural  steel,  structural  concrete, HMA top course, bridge railing, guide rail, median barrier, impact attenuators, retaining walls, bridge bearings, etc. must be submitted to the RLPL for review and approval by the appropriate program area per Table 8-1, Project Approvals Matrix.

Materials called out under a Special Specification will be accepted based upon certification of conformance to the Special Specification, by a NYS-licensed design professional.

Use and approval of Special Specifications must be documented in the Plans, Specifications &amp; Estimate (PS&amp;E)/Contract Document transmittal letter.

## 9.3.3.1 Proprietary Items

Under 23 CFR 635.411 Material and Product Selection federal funds must not be used, directly or  indirectly,  in  payment  for  any  premium  or  royalty  on  any  patented  or  proprietary  material, specification,  or  process  specifically  set  forth  in  the  plans  and  specifications  for  a  project, unless:  (1)  such  patented  or  proprietary  item  is  purchased  or  obtained  through  competitive bidding  with  equally  suitable  unpatented  items;  or  (2)  the  state  transportation  department certifies  either  that  such  patented  or  proprietary  item  is  essential  for  synchronization  with existing highway facilities, or that no equally suitable alternate exists - this alternative may be pursued if the appropriate approval authority identified in the Project Approvals Matrix finds the use of the article or material to be in the public interest - or (3) such patented or proprietary item is used for research or for a distinctive type of construction on relatively short sections of road for experimental purposes.

To  obtain  approval  for  a  Special  Specification  for  a  proprietary  item  a  justification  must  be prepared showing how the request is in compliance with one or more of the points mentioned above.  This approval may be obtained only on a project-by-project basis (HDM Chapter 21).

Revised

March 2011

Special Specifications calling out a single manufacturer's item to be used on an urban street project  for  drainage  basins,  water  valves,  and  manhole  covers  in  order  to  match  current designs -  are  in  conflict  with  the  above  CFR.    This  conflict  may  be  resolved  by  either  (a) providing "as  manufactured  by [at  least  two,  preferably  three  (for  competitive  purposes)  firms typically manufacturing/forging such castings],' requiring knowledge that each foundry/company can produce the specified casting; or (b) providing a generically written specification providing dimensioning, engineering properties and the municipality's raised letter name/logo.

## 9.3.3.2 Salvage

In lieu of salvage, miscellaneous highway appurtenances , dismantled bridge superstructures, 9 and bituminous concrete millings which are determined to have little maintenance value should be turned over to the contractor for disposal in order to avoid costs associated with re-handling. Contract bid prices should then reflect the scrap value of these items.

The Sponsor may elect to salvage appurtenances and pavement millings for future maintenance use.    Bridge  beams,  girders  and  other  superstructure  materials  from  dismantled  bridges  can also be appropriate for salvage.  No credit to federal-aid funding is required for salvaged items as long as the following conditions are met:

- 1.   Salvaged material is to be used for highway maintenance and not sold as scrap.
- 2.   Additional cost is not incurred for special handling or replacement of material damaged during salvage operations.
- 3.   As a rule, specifications shall not call out for the contractor to deliver salvaged material to the Sponsor's maintenance yards.  Occasionally, however, exemptions to this Federal policy (stated in 23 CFR 635.407(g)) regarding transport are appropriate and should be within a reasonable distance.  Requests seeking exemptions will be based on meeting the  requirements of 1 &amp; 2 above, in addition to providing environmental benefits as a result  of  incorporating  the  salvage  material  into  future  highway  maintenance  activities (recycling versus disposal).  The exemption should be in the form of a Public Interest Finding.  Material requiring delivery and the location to be delivered should be identified in a special note.

Disposition  of  millings  and  recycled  materials  shall  be  described  in  a  Special  Note  in  the contract documents.

## 9.4 ENGINEERING INFORMATION ISSUANCES AND CONSULTANT INSTRUCTIONS

NYSDOT  publishes  three  types  of  issuances  to  guide  engineering  practice;  an  Engineering Directive (ED), Engineering Instruction (EI), and Engineering Bulletin (EB).  Sponsors are only required to follow those issuances pertinent to their specific project or applicable to Federal-aid projects in general.  Sponsors and their designers are responsible for keeping up-to-date with current issuances of EDs, EIs, and EBs.  RLPLs will do their best to keep Sponsors informed about relevant issuances coming into effect.

EDs are issued by the NYSDOT Chief Engineer to convey information deemed critical to the continuation  of  essential  engineering  activities.    They  are  issued  infrequently,  can  be  timesensitive, and take effect upon issuance.

EIs are issued to announce NYSDOT is changing some aspect of its current policy, standards, guidelines, or specifications contained in manuals such as the Highway Design Manual , Bridge Manual , Standard  Specifications , Standard  Sheets , Manual  of  Uniform  Record  Keeping (MURK), Project Development Manual , etc.  Els also issue direction, guidance, or explanation of policy  or  procedures  that  will  not  be  incorporated  elsewhere.    EIs  often  have  extensive supporting  or  related  material  attached,  referenced,  or  distributed  by  other  means  (with instructions on how to obtain).  EIs take effect as announced in the EI or if it affects the Capital Letting program on one of three annual effective dates, and remain in effect unless, or until, a subsequent EI or EB directs otherwise.

EBs  are  used  to  announce  NYSDOT  is  issuing  a  new  publication,  or  amending  an  existing publication, such as the HDM Bridge Manual , , etc., or that such amendments are available from NYSDOT.   EBs can also transmit replacement pages for existing publications including current Els, rescind a current EI, issue temporary guidance, or extend the effective date of an EB soon to  expire.    Other  materials  are  often  attached.    EBs  take  effect  as  announced  in  the  EB  and expire one year after issuance.

Additional  information,  how  to  get  copies,  how  to  be  added  to  the  distribution  list,  etc.  is available on NYSDOT's Engineering Information Issuance System.

Consultant  Instructions 10 (prepared  by  the  Contract  Management  Bureau)  are  issuances  that can also be applicable, and so should regularly be checked by Sponsors.
